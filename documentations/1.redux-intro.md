### Basic Use of Redux 

#### About Repository
- This repository is created to practice the basics of state managements with redux.

- In ``redux-intro``, basic view of redux is shown. In ``redux-with-react``, basic counter (decrement/increment 1) app is practiced with redux fundamentals.


- Firstly, we need to install react and redux.

```sh
npx create-react-app redux-intro
```

> **Notes:** As told earlier, 'create-react-app' doesn't include redux.

```sh
cd redux-intro
npm install redux
```

> **Notes:** Let's remember main subjects shortly before practice in order to understand better with implementations.
#### Store 
- Store is central location where we keep our global level states (application level state).
#### Global Level State 
- Some of our datas in the application need to be stored as globally, so that we can access it anywhere using redux state management. 
#### Reducers 
- Reducers are functions that take the ``current state`` and an ``action`` as arguments, and return ``a new state result``. In other words; ``(state, action) => newState``

#### Actions 
- Actions define what we want to do. But it doesn't apply, it just defines. 

#### Dispatch
- ``dispatch`` is a function of the Redux store. You call store.dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.

- Let's go to `redux-intro/src/index.js`

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";
import { createStore } from "redux";

// ACTIONS -> Increment
const increment = () => {
  return {
    type: "INCREMENT",
  };
};

// ACTIONS -> Decrement
const decrement = () => {
  return {
    type: "DECREMENT",
  };
};

// REDUCER
const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return state + 1;
    case "DECREMENT":
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// STORE -> Globalized State
let store = createStore(counter); // Creating the store (globalized state)

// STORE FUNCTIONS: subscribe(), dispatch(), getState()

// DISPLAY the values of state on the console
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState())); // Prints value of the state on the console.

// DISPATCH
store.dispatch(increment()); // Increments the state by 1. (Makes it 1, beacuse initial value is 0)
store.dispatch(decrement()); // Decrements the state by 1. (Makes it 0, beacuse current value is 1)
store.dispatch(decrement()); // Decrements the state by 1. (Makes it -1, beacuse current value is 0)
store.dispatch(decrement()); // Decrements the state by 1. (Makes it -2, beacuse current value is -1)

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

#### Step by Step

- Initially, import `createStore` from `redux`: 
```sh
import { createStore } from "redux";
```

- Then, define our actions for increment and decrement operations:
```sh
// Actions -> Increment
const increment = () => {
  return {
    type: 'INCREMENT'
  }
}

// Actions -> Decrement 
const decrement = () => {
  return {
    type: 'DECREMENT'
  }
}
```

- Notice that, we just 'define' actions to increment and decrement.

- After that, create our reducer: 
```sh
// REDUCER
const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return state + 1;
    case "DECREMENT":
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```
- Remember that: Reducers are functions that take the ``current state`` and an ``action`` as arguments, and return ``a new state result``. In other words; ``(state, action) => newState``

- Then, create store where we keep global states, and send reducer: 
```sh
// STORE -> Globalized State
let store = createStore(counter);  // Creating the store (globalized state)
```

- Then, we need to see updated value of current state at console: 
```
// DISPLAY it on the console
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));  // Prints 1 at console. (Updated value of the state)
```

- After that, we call store.dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change:
```sh
// DISPATCH
store.dispatch(increment()); // Increments the state by 1. (Makes it 1, beacuse initial value is 0)
store.dispatch(decrement()); // Decrements the state by 1. (Makes it 0, beacuse current value is 1)
store.dispatch(decrement()); // Decrements the state by 1. (Makes it -1, beacuse current value is 0)
store.dispatch(decrement()); // Decrements the state by 1. (Makes it -2, beacuse current value is -1)
```
